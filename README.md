# Coding Sample - Masters Research Project - Nishan Ghimire - Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU)
This GitHub repository has the coding sample for my Master's Research Project titled "Estimating the Tax Progressivity for Canada and the US"

This repository has the following Excel Files:

1)	1992-2022 Canada Regression: The data and computations in this file are based on federal income tax for Canada from 1992 to 2022.
2)	Fed and Prov 1992-2022 Canada: The data and computations in this file are based on federal and provincial income tax for Canada from 1992 to 2022.
3)	US Regression 1979-2021: The data and computations in this file are for the United States from 1979 to 2021
4)	Sample for Kakwani Index: The data in this file is to generate the Kakwani Index for the US and Canada (both using federal income tax and combining federal and provincial income taxes)
5)	Sample for RS Index: The data in this file is to generate the Reynolds-Smolensky (RS) Index for the US and Canada (both using federal income tax and combining federal and provincial income taxes)
6)	Indices: This includes graphs of the Kakwani Index and the Reynolds-Smolensky (RS) index for the US and Canada.
7)	ATR US and Canada: This includes graphs for the Average Tax Rates (ATRs) for the US and Canada.
8)	Canada and US Shares Graphs: This includes graphs for shares of before-tax income, after-tax income and paid taxes for the US (1979 and 2021) and Canada (both using federal income tax and combining federal and provincial income taxes for 1992 and 2022). This file also includes the same measures for the Reagan, Bush, and Trump administrations, as well as the Martin and Harper governments. 
9)	Canada Regression OECD results: The data and computations in this file are based on OECD data for Canada from 1992 to 2022. 

R file instructions: 
To run the File “R File for Table and Indices”, change the address of the “setwd” at the top of the program to your current file address, and it should run successfully. 

Output File:
If you want to look at the final output file after running the R file, please see the file: “R-File-for-Table-and-Indices.pdf.”
